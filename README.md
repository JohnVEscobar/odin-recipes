Live Site: https://johnvescobar.github.io/odin-recipes/

In this project I will be creating a HTML website for Odin's HTML tutorial. This website wil link to various recipes, and by the end of this project I will have demonstrated mastery over basic html skills including how to properly format a page, link to various other pages, add images, create and organize lists, and utilize git functions.

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Brazilian stroganoff is a unique twist on the classic Russian dish, adapted to suit Brazilian taste preferences.
             Introduced in the mid-20th century, Brazilian stroganoff quickly gained popularity and became a beloved comfort 
             food in the country. This variation typically features tender strips of beef cooked in a creamy sauce made with 
             ketchup, mustard, onions, mushrooms, and sometimes heavy cream. The flavor profile is rich, tangy, and slightly 
             sweet, combining the savory notes of the beef with the creamy and tangy elements of the sauce. It is commonly 
             served over white rice and accompanied by crispy shoestring potatoes, creating a satisfying and flavorful combination. 
             The Brazilian adaptation of stroganoff showcases the fusion of international influences with local ingredients and culinary preferences, 
             resulting in a delicious and distinctive dish.</p>

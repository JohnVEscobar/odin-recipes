    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brazilian Maracujá Mousse, also known as Passion Fruit Mousse, is a popular and refreshing dessert in Brazil. 
        It has a history rooted in the country's love for tropical fruits and culinary creativity. The mousse showcases 
        the vibrant and tangy flavor of maracujá, or passion fruit, which is a cherished fruit in Brazil. The dessert is 
        made by combining the pulp of fresh passion fruit with condensed milk and whipped cream to create a light and airy 
        texture. The flavor profile is a delightful balance of sweet and tart, with the tropical notes of passion fruit shining 
        through. The mousse is often served chilled, garnished with fresh passion fruit seeds or a drizzle of passion fruit syrup, 
        offering a taste of Brazil's tropical paradise in every spoonful.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4-5 passion fruits (maracujá), depending on size</li>
            <li>1 can (14 ounces) of sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of unflavored gelatin (optional)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of sugar (optional, for extra sweetness)</li>
            <li>Fresh passion fruit seeds or syrup, for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the passion fruits in half and scoop out the pulp using a spoon. Set aside some of the fresh seeds for garnish if desired.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the condensed milk with the passion fruit pulp. Stir until well mixed.</li>
            <li>If you prefer a firmer texture, you can dissolve the gelatin in 2 tablespoons of warm water and let 
                it sit for a few minutes. Then, gently warm the gelatin mixture in the microwave for a few seconds 
                until it becomes liquid. Add the gelatin to the condensed milk and passion fruit mixture, stirring well.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Gently fold the whipped cream into the condensed milk and passion fruit mixture. If desired, add sugar to taste and mix gently until everything is well incorporated.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into individual serving glasses or a large serving bowl. Smooth the top with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate the mousse for at least 2 hours, or until set.</li>
            <li>Before serving, garnish the mousse with fresh passion fruit seeds or a drizzle of passion fruit syrup, if desired.</li>
        </ol>

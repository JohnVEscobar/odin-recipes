    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Feijoada is a traditional Brazilian dish with a rich history and a captivating flavor profile. 
           Originating from the time of Portuguese colonization, feijoada has evolved into a beloved national dish. 
           It is a hearty black bean stew made with various cuts of pork, such as sausages, bacon, and ribs, along with beef and sometimes smoked meats. 
           Slow-cooked with onions, garlic, and a medley of spices, this dish showcases a harmonious blend of flavors—salty and savory from the meats, earthy 
           and nutty from the beans, and subtly spiced with a hint of smokiness. Feijoada is typically served with rice, collard greens, orange slices, and a 
           sprinkle of farofa (toasted cassava flour) to add texture. Its deep flavors and comforting nature make feijoada a delightful experience that reflects 
           the cultural and culinary tapestry of Brazil.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams of black beans </li>
        <li>500 grams of assorted pork cuts (sausages, bacon, ribs, etc.)</li>
        <li>250 grams of beef (such as stewing beef or beef brisket)</li>
        <li>1/2 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 tbs of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tbs of smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp of ground cumin</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Water, as needed</li>
        <li>Farofa (toasted cassava flour), for serving</li>
        <li>Cooked white rice, for serving</li>
        <li>Collard greens, for serving</li>
        <li>Orange slices, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the black beans under cold water and soak them overnight. Alternatively, you can use the quick-soak method by boiling the beans for 2 minutes, removing them from heat, and letting them sit for 1 hour before draining.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until fragrant and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the assorted pork cuts and beef to the pot, and cook until they start to brown, releasing their juices.</li>
        <li>Stir in the smoked paprika, ground cumin, bay leaves, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to coat the meats with the spices.</li>
        <li>Drain the soaked beans and add them to the pot. Pour enough water to cover the ingredients by a couple of inches.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer, partially covered, for about 2 to 3 hours or until the beans are tender and the meats are cooked and tender.</li>
        <li>During the cooking process, check the liquid level occasionally and add more water if necessary to keep the stew from drying out.</li>
        <li>Once the beans and meats are cooked, taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.</li>
        <li>Remove the bay leaves from the pot.</li>
        <li>Serve feijoada hot, accompanied by cooked rice, collard greens, orange slices, and farofa.</li>
    </ol>
